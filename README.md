# 🔥 ShoutBin

**ShoutBin** is a zero-knowledge, self-destructing pastebin for encrypted messages.  
All encryption and decryption occurs on the client side, ensuring the server never sees plaintext data.  
Each message is linked to a unique, unguessable URL and is automatically deleted after successful decryption or expiration.

## Features

- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption**  
  Messages are encrypted and decrypted in the browser.

- 💥 **Self-Destructing Messages**  
  Messages are deleted after successful decryption or expiration.

- 🧠 **Zero Knowledge**  
  The server stores only ciphertext. Keys never leave the client.
