# 🔥 ShoutBin

**ShoutBin** is a zero-knowledge, self-destructing pastebin for encrypted messages.  
All encryption and decryption occurs on the client side, ensuring the server never sees plaintext data.  
Each message is linked to a unique, unguessable URL and is automatically deleted after expiration or access.

## Features

- 🧠 **Zero Knowledge**
